     Prepare chocolate cake layers. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (180C). Grease two 8 inch (20cm) pans and line the bottom with parchment paper. In a medium bowl combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. In another bowl mix the butter and sugar until  well combined. Add eggs, one at a time, vanilla extract and mix to combine. With the mixer on low, gradually add flour mixture alternating with sour cream until all is well incorporated. Add the melted chocolate and mix to incorporate. Divide batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs. Let them cool on the pan for about 10 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack to cool completely. Meanwhile prepare the raspberry filling. Place raspberries, sugar and lemon juice into a saucepan and bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Simmer for 10-15 minute or until thickens. Remove from heat and set aside to cool until ready to use. Prepare chocolate ganache for filling.  Place chopped chocolate into a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan, until almost boiling to the edges. Remove from heat and pour over the chocolate. Let sit for 2 minutes and then stir until smooth. Let cool at room temperature. Assemble the cake. Cut the tops of the cakes to create flat surfaces. Cut each cake in half horizontally. Place one cake layer on your serving plate. Add sheets of parchment paper until you frost the cake. Add the second layer of cake and spread with the cooled chocolate ganache. Add the third layer of cake and spread the remaining raspberry filling. Add the last layer of cake and refrigerate until ready to frost. Prepare the whipped ganache for frosting the top and edges of the cake.   Place chopped chocolate into a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan, until almost boiling to the edges. Remove from heat and pour over the chocolate. Let sit for 2 minutes and then stir until smooth. Refrigerate for 60-70 minutes. Whip the ganache until soft peaks form and gets lighter in color. Frost the top and edges of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for few hours or overnight. Prepare chocolate shards. Melt 3.5 oz (100g) semisweet chocolate over bain-marie. Remove from heat and add 1 oz (30g) chopped semisweet chocolate for tempering. Stir until melted. Spread chocolate evenly into a 14 x 12 inch (36x30cm) rectangle on a parchment paper. Roll the parchment paper and refrigerate for 30-40 minutes. Unroll the parchment paper and the chocolate will break into shards. Make them smaller if desired and they are ready to decorate the cake. Use melted chocolate to stick each shard on the side of the cake. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to set the shards.  Cover the cake with fresh raspberries and dust with a bit of powdered sugar.
